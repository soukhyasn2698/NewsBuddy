## üîß Quick Fixes

2. Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`
3. Check for JavaScript syntax errors in console

### If No Articles Load:
1. Check internet connection
2. Try different news sources
3. Check background script console for RSS fetch errors

### If View More Button Missing:
1. Look for the temporary debug message: "DEBUG: View More Button"
2. If that appears, the HTML/CSS is working
3. If not, check HTML structure and CSS styles
